                <p class="mb-0 mt-1 font-small line-height-3">Coming from a need for a simple budget planner, 
                I built Budget.cool as an app to help build better spending habits and keep track of my expenses. After 
                being in a private beta for a few months, it was launched on Product Hunt where it got #3 Product of the Day.
                It's currently running a Laravel back-end and a Vue front-end.

                <p class="mb-0 mt-1 font-small line-height-3">Something else built from a need, this time the ability to 
                easily view log errors and model changes on my Laravel apps, and get notified when something goes awry. 
                Installed easily as a Composer package, Larametrics is able to keep track of any errors or notices logged, 
                database models updated, and routes requested.

                <p class="mb-0 mt-1 font-small line-height-3">A front-end framework for rapid web development and 
                prototyping. Calcite was created to be a powerful development toolbelt, utilizing low-level utility classes 
                in order to control and modify an element's specific styling. This website uses it combined with 
                purify-css, yielding a unique looking front-end with less than 10kb of production CSS.</p>

                <p class="mb-0 mt-1 font-small line-height-3">Shallot was a solution to a problem where I needed to send out emails to a client 
                at a certain time period, using my custom-domain email address. I knew some existed for 
                Gmail, but nothing that I could readily find for my needs. Shallot lets you 
                write and schedule simple emails that get sent out under any email address you specify.</p>

                <h3>ü¶ê Taro</h3>
                <p class="mb-0 mt-1 font-small line-height-3">From a desire to create a super simplistic static-site generator 
                Taro was born. It utilizes Laravel Blade templating and comes with Laravel Mix's asset compiler pre-configured. 
                Pages are organized through a single JSON file, where SEO details can be configured and additional variables 
                added and passed through to the Blade templates. With build speed as a priority, compiling a modest 20 page 
                site takes ~50 milliseconds.</p>

                <p class="mb-0 mt-1 font-small line-height-3">I noticed that there weren't really any job boards specifically 
                targeted for my area, so I set out to make one and populate it. The back-end is a Laravel application with 
                a front-end built with Vue and Bootstrap's grid. During regular intervals a cron job calls the Indeed.com API 
                and pulls in jobs within the tri-county area. Signing into the administration panel lets you moderate what 
                jobs appear on the front-end.</p>
