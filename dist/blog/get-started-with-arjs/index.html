            <p>Augmented Reality seems like itâ€™s everywhere in 2018. Between Snapchat filters, Google stickers, IKEAâ€™s furniture preview, and now Shopifyâ€™s <a href="https://medium.com/shopify-vr/ar-shopping-gets-simpler-with-ar-quick-look-on-shopify-c2716593823f" class="color-red" target="_blank">AR Quick Look</a> feature, putting 3D objects in the physical world seems to be more desirable than ever.</p>
            <p>While an augmented reality feature might fit nicely into an established native application, thereâ€™s a downside to those non-app-based businesses whoâ€™d like to use AR for marketing purposes. For instance, say a handbag company wants to display a 3D model of a handbag above the box it ships in when the user points their camera at their logo on the box. Traditionally, theyâ€™d have to:</p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Develop a native application using ARKit/ARCore/ARToolkit/etc</li>
                    <li>Pay the requested fees to get it distributed to the Google Play/App Stores</li>
                    <li>Wait for approval from either of the above stores</li>
                    <li>Market the application to your prospective customers/users</li>
                    <li>Hope that the user downloads and then uses the app</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>All of this for what amounts to (on average) a 2â€“5 minute session playing around with the finished app. Additionally if itâ€™s for a specific marketing campaign or time span, theyâ€™re more than likely not going to interact with it more than a few times.</p>
            <p>The solution? <a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js/blob/master/README.md" class="color-red" target="_blank"><strong>AR.js</strong></a>, simple augmented reality directly in the browser and compatible with all modern mobile devices. Now, letâ€™s get started!</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><h3>What is AR.js?</h3></p>
            <p>To boil it down, itâ€™s essentially a Javascript framework acting as a port of ARToolkit, while leveraging other packages like <a href="https://aframe.io/" class="color-red" target="_blank">a-frame</a> and <a href="https://threejs.org/" class="color-red" target="_blank">three.js</a>. The goal being augmented reality features directly on web browsers without sacrificing performance.</p>
            <p>As far as compatibility goes, it works on any browser capable of WebGL + WebRTC. At the publishing time of this article, that would be Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari. However, the current version of Chrome for iOS is <strong>not</strong> supported as of yet.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><h3>Getting a project set up</h3></p>
            <p>This assumes that you have a (local or otherwise) development environment already set up and secured with an SSL certificate. <em><strong>Why SSL?</strong> Chrome requires all sites that use scripts calling for camera access to be delivered strictly over https.</em></p>
            <p>Following from <a href="https://medium.com/@AndraConnect?source=post_header_lockup" class="color-red" target="_blank">Alexandra Etienneâ€™s</a> article we can have a working demo of AR.js up in just <strong>8 lines of HTML</strong>.</p>
            <p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*9JPgSiBdvtWyx9ELbLZ2ew.png" alt="Getting started with AR.js in just 8 lines of HTML"></p>
            <p>Throw that bad boy into an index.html file on your dev environment and open it up in your compatible browser of choice. Youâ€™ll get a request to access your camera, and on approval will see a live video feed from your device. Print out/load up the <a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js/blob/master/data/images/hiro.png" class="color-red" target="_blank">default hiro marker</a> image and point it at the video feed. If everything went well, you should see a semi-clear white cube fixed over the marker.</p>

            <p>Want to remove the debug boxes from the video display? Simply add the flag â€˜debugUIEnabled: false;â€™ to the arjs prop in the <strong>a-scene</strong> element.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><h3>Using custom markers</h3></p>
            <p>This was honestly one of the most difficult pieces for me to get working properly when I was originally learning AR.js. Thereâ€™s a few tutorials out there about how to get custom markers working, but between them thereâ€™s some conflicting information. Iâ€™m going to give the run-down of what worked best for me, broken down step by step.</p>
            <p><strong>Step 1. Decide on your marker image.</strong> For the best results this should be a simple, high-contrast, PNG image pre-cropped to be a square with a size of at least 512x512. This also has to be rotationally asymmetrical, meaning that it will always look unique regardless of the degree itâ€™s rotated to. Hereâ€™s some good examples of marker images:</p>
            <p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*zUxIO_eUSMyDg4Nq0FPY1g.png" alt="Examples of good AR.js markers"></p>
            <p><strong>Step 2. Convert your image to a .patt file and an AR.js marker.</strong> Using <a href="https://jeromeetienne.github.io/AR.js/three.js/examples/marker-training/examples/generator.html" class="color-red" target="_blank">this marker trainer</a>, upload an image that youâ€™d like to use as a marker. If it looks good to you, then go ahead and click:</p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Download Marker: The .patt file AR.js uses to recognize the marker and display your 3D content.</li>
                    <li>Download Image: The actual .png image with the appropriate black border to be used as the physical marker.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p><strong>Step 3. Add the .patt file to your website.</strong> It really doesnâ€™t matter where as long as itâ€™s accessible to the application, I usually put mine in my assets folder using a structure like /img/patterns/my-marker.patt.</p>
            <p><strong>Step 4. Add the marker to your AR.js element.</strong> Using the a-frame method, this is very simple. All you need to do is add an <strong>a-marker</strong> element with a type prop of â€˜patternâ€™, and the relative path to your pattern file as the â€˜urlâ€™ prop.</p>
            <p>Using this method we will also need to include an <strong>a-entity camera</strong> so that the virtual camera is included in the 3D environment being rendered.</p>
            <p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*cyOLiJDEH0qlLOKOZJXaQw.png" alt="Code screenshot of adding in a custom marker to an AR.js application"></p>
            <p><strong>Step 5. Finally, add in the 3D model you would like to display.</strong> To complete this, we need to add in a model thatâ€™ll be shown when this marker is discovered. Thankfully, a-frame includes a bunch of primitive geometries that we can easily drop-in using some simple element names.</p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>&lt;a-box&gt;&lt;/a-box&gt;</li>
                    <li>&lt;a-box&gt;&lt;/a-box&gt;</li>
                    <li>&lt;a-cylinder&gt;&lt;/a-cylinder&gt;</li>
                    <li>&lt;a-plane&gt;&lt;/a-plane&gt;</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Each of these have a position prop that can be adjusted to allow you to move it around the 3D space relative to the marker position. This way your objects donâ€™t need to sit directly on the marker but can float above it, or off to the side. For this example, Iâ€™m going to add in a red sphere that floats just slightly above the marker.</p>
            <p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*zSw6QgOr9Ok7wYaTFlSuSQ.png" alt="Adding in a 3D model to an AR.js application"></p>
            <p>Boom ðŸ’¥</p>
            <p>Replace the previous boilerplate with the new custom pattern code, and show your downloaded marker image to the camera. You should see a red sphere floating just above the marker icon!</p>
            <p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*sVsjfTeLUND_hwEFx-JAOw.png" alt="A screenshot showing an example of a simple AR.js application"></p>
            <p>This might seem pretty simple, but when you consider that we did this in just a dozen lines of HTML the power and possibility of using AR.js really shines through.</p>
